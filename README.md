# TwitchChatBotIntegration
Allows users to read and write text from/to IRC Twitch chat as a substitute for user input for some of my previous existing projects. Config.java contains the main method of the program. Currently Bot.java at the moment is set up to add users to a text file that is loaded and saved each time the command is run if they are interested in entering a tournament I would like to host using the command !interest, and has the ability to display that current list in the chatroom using !list. It can also tell the user what the current game is, currently it is !gamename. There are eight other commands that are used that allow the user to send user input to my computer so that I can allow them to interact and play a game (currently Pokemon Gold) using commands: !up, !down, !left, !right, !a, !b, !start, !select. There are a bunch of other commands I haven't mentioned yet that you can modify and edit or delete that are already done for you, just check Bot.java for more details.


Instructions: 
1) Make sure you have an updated JDK, to do that, make sure you visit https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html and download the latest JDK.

2) Download the files from my repository, by hitting the green button that says code on it, and unzip them.

3a) Make a separate twitch account for your bot\
3b) Get your oauth code from https://twitchapps.com/tmi/ \
3c) Modify the template arguments.txt file to fit your own username and bot rather than the placeholder example: 


       Modify the arguments.txt file to a 4 lined .txt file containing:
       1) Your Twitch username
       2) Your oauth code generated from "https://twitchapps.com/tmi/"
       3) The current game you are playing
       4) Your Twitch bot's username

       Sample arguments.txt file: 
       (PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU UPDATE AND SAVE THIS FILE OR YOU WILL NOT CONNECT TO THE CORRECT CHANNEL)

       TwitchPlaysPokemon
       oauth:123a4bcdefghijklmn5678o9pqrst0
       Twitch Plays
       tpp

4a) Open up cmd on Windows or the terminal on Linux and change the current directory to the folder that you unzipped \
4b) compile Config.java and Bot.java:

       Windows:
       javac -cp ".;pircbot.jar" Config.java Bot.java
       
       Linux:
       javac -cp ".:pircbot.jar" Config.java Bot.java

4c) run Config.java:

       Windows:
       java -cp .;pircbot.jar Config
       
       Linux:
       java -cp .:pircbot.jar Config

(For Windows users you can alternatively compile and run which is just steps 4b and 4c at the same time simply by double clicking on the TwitchBot.cmd file in the folder. If the .cmd file closes instantly, then you need to double check that you have an up enough to date JDK as mentioned in step 1, if instead it doesn't close but is stuck in an endless disconnect loop then you should manually close the file and double check if your arguments.txt file is changed to your specifications and NOT the sample's all of which is done in step 3c.)

If done successfully you should be greeted with something like this:

      Bot is now connected to the channel.
      12/30/2020 03:51:08: *** Connected to server.
      12/30/2020 03:51:08: *** Logged onto server.
      12/30/2020 03:51:08: tpp: JOIN
      12/30/2020 03:51:08: :tmi.twitch.tv USERSTATE #twitchplayspokemon
      12/30/2020 03:51:08: :tmi.twitch.tv ROOMSTATE #twitchplayspokemon

of course except with a different datetime, and your own username and bot rather than the sample's.


5) Once you made sure that's up and running you are good to go! Don't forget to give your bot moderator privileges in your channel "/mod <botname>" for full effect. You can edit the java files to do whatever you want to do with them (Bot.java specifically deals with all the commands) with your favorite text editor, but if you change anything then repeat steps 4b) and 4c) for the changes to take effect. 

6) I use this bot in tandem with StreamElement's for all of the verified bot's privileges that you can't get with this unverified bot, so optionally you can go and get StreamElement's bot as well. https://streamelements.com/ . Their bot gives you less freedom with what you can do like you cannot customize StreamElements to affect your keyboard like you can with this bot for example, but can still do special things integrated into Twitch's database itself such as look up someone's followage to your channel or how long they have had a channel for, for example. That's why it's nice to have this custom bot and a well established bot together.
