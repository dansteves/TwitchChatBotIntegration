# TwitchChatBotIntegration
Allows users to read and write text from/to IRC Twitch chat as a substitute for user input for some of my previous existing projects. Config.java contains the main method of the program and you must run three arguments: your twitch username, your oauth key, and the name of the game you are playing. Bot.java is where all of my existing commands are. Currently Bot.java at the moment is set up to add users to a text file that is loaded and saved each time the command is run if they are interested in entering a tournament I would like to host using the command !interest, and has the ability to display that current list in the chatroom using !list. It can also tell the user what the current game is, currently it is !test but I may change this later. There are eight other commands that are used that allow the user to send user input to my computer so that I can allow them to interact and play a game (currently Pokemon Gold) using commands: !up, !down, !left, !right, !a, !b, !start, !select.
